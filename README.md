# Terralysis : Soil Identification App (Android)
<p align="justify">
  With the help of Terralysis, farmers and researchers can capture photos of the soil they wish to identify and submit them through the application. The software analyzes the visual characteristics of the soil, such as color, texture, and composition, and compares them to a comprehensive database of soil types. Based on this analysis, Terralysis provides users with information about the specific soil type present in the photo.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The application aims to increase agricultural productivity and maintain soil health by enabling users to make informed decisions tailored to the specific characteristics of their soil. By knowing the soil type, farmers can select crops that are well-suited to that particular soil, implement cultivation techniques that are appropriate for its characteristics, and apply fertilizers in a targeted manner, thus optimizing crop growth and production while preserving soil health.
